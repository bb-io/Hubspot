 <h1>Introducing Phrase Auto Adapt</h1><p><strong>Phrase Auto Adapt</strong> is an AI-powered solution that continuously refines translation outputs based on real-world feedback and performance. Designed to work seamlessly across localization workflows, Auto Adapt ensures translations stay aligned with your unique style, terminology, and tone.</p><p>Rather than relying on static models or traditional rule-based systems, Auto Adapt <em>learns from every interaction</em>. It monitors how translations perform in context and identifies opportunities for automatic improvement — dramatically reducing manual post-editing and review cycles.</p><h2>Why Use Auto Adapt?</h2><ul><li><strong>Adaptive Quality:</strong> Translations improve over time with usage, not just data.</li><li><strong>Low Effort:</strong> No need for complex retraining or manual updates — the system adapts automatically.</li><li><strong>Brand Consistency:</strong> Auto Adapt tailors output to your specific domain, terminology, and voice.</li></ul><h2>How It Works</h2><p>Auto Adapt analyzes user edits, review patterns, and contextual metadata. It then retrains custom models in the background, applying these improvements in real-time to future translations. This creates a feedback loop where the quality of translations increases the more they're used.</p><p>It integrates directly into Phrase's localization platform, so you don't need to manage additional infrastructure or vendor relationships. Just turn it on and start seeing results.</p><blockquote><em>"With Auto Adapt, our translation quality increased significantly without lifting a finger."</em> – Phrase Customer</blockquote><p>To learn more, visit <a href="https://phrase.com/phrase-quality-technologies/auto-adapt/">Phrase Auto Adapt</a>.</p>
